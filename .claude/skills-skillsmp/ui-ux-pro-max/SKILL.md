description: UI/UX design intelligence and implementation guidance for building polished interfaces. Use when the user asks for UI design, UX flows, information architecture, visual style direction, design systems/tokens, component specs, copy/microcopy, accessibility, or to generate/critique/refine frontend UI (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Tailwind). Includes workflows for (1) generating new UI layouts and styling, (2) improving existing UI/UX, (3) producing design-system tokens and component guidelines, and (4) turning UX recommendations into concrete code changes.

Follow these steps to deliver high-quality UI/UX output with minimal back-and-forth.

## 1) Triage
Ask only what you must to avoid wrong work:
- Target platform: web / iOS / Android / desktop
- Stack (if code changes): React/Next/Vue/Svelte, CSS/Tailwind, component library
- Goal and constraints: conversion, speed, brand vibe, accessibility level (WCAG AA?)
- What you have: screenshot, Figma, repo, URL, user journey

## 2) Produce Deliverables (pick what fits)
Always be concrete: name components, states, spacing, typography, and interactions.

- **UI concept + layout**: Provide a clear visual direction, grid, typography, color system, key screens/sections.
- **UX flow**: Map the user journey, critical paths, error/empty/loading states, edge cases.
- **Design system**: Tokens (color/typography/spacing/radius/shadow), component rules, accessibility notes.
- **Implementation plan**: Exact file-level edits, component breakdown, and acceptance criteria.

## 3) Output Standards
- Default to ASCII-only tokens/variables unless the project already uses Unicode.
- Include: spacing scale, type scale, 2-3 font pair options, color tokens, component states.
- Always cover: empty/loading/error, keyboard navigation, focus states, contrast.
